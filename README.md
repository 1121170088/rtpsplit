# Introduction

With rtpbreak you can detect, reconstruct and analyze any RTP session. It doesn't require the presence of RTCP packets and works independently form the used signaling protocol (SIP, H.323, SCCP, ...). The input is a sequence of packets, the output is a set of files you can use as input for other tools (wireshark/tshark, sox, grep/awk/cut/cat/sed, ...). It supports also wireless (AP_DLT_IEEE802_11) networks. 
This is a list of scenarios where rtpbreak is a good choice:
* reconstruct any RTP stream with an unknown or unsupported signaling protocol
* reconstruct any RTP stream in wireless networks, while doing channel hopping (VoIP activity detector)
* reconstruct and decode any RTP stream in batch mode (with sox, asterisk, ...)
* reconstruct any already existing RTP stream
* reorder the packets of any RTP stream for later analysis (with tshark, wireshark, ...)
* build a tiny wireless VoIP tapping system in a single chip Linux unit
* build a complete VoIP tapping system (rtpbreak would be just the RTP dissector module!)

## Usage

The unique mandatory input parameter is the packet source (network interface or pcap file). This is the list of accepted parameters:
```
INPUT
-r <str>
Read packets from file (pcap format) <str>
-i <str>
Read packets from network interface <str>
-L <int>
Force the datalink header length to <int> bytes. This is useful if the interface type is not correctly recognized by libpcap
OUTPUT
-d <str>
Set the output directory to <str>
-w
Disable the raw dump of RTP sessions
-W
Disable the pcap dump of RTP sessions
-g
Fill the gaps of lost packets in raw dumps with the last sniffed packet, preventing desynchronization problems when decoding/mixing multiple RTP streams (with sox, ...)
-n
Dump packets passing the single packet pattern but not the multiple packets pattern (the noise packets) to pcap file
-f
Disable stdout logging
-F
Enable syslog logging
-v
Be verbose
SELECT
-m
Sniff packets in promiscuous mode
-p <str>
Consider only packets matching the libpcap filter <str>
-e
Expect an even destination UDP port. The RTP packets must have an even destination UDP port. This should be always true, anyway some VoIP networks (like Yahoo) don't respect this rule
-u
Expect unprivileged source/destination UDP ports (> 1024). This should always be true
-y <int>
The RTP packets must have exactly this payload type. For example, if we want only RTP streams with data encoded in G.711 ulaw, we should add the option -y 0, value obtained from the -k option
-l <int>
The RTP payload length must be exactly <int> bytes
-t <float>
Consider terminated any session without new packets for <float> seconds
-T <float>
Consider a timeout of <float> seconds in the pattern over multiple packets
-P <int>
Consider <int> packets in the pattern over multiple packets
EXECUTION
-Z <str>
Run as user <str>
-D
Run in background (option -f implicit)
MISC
-k
Dump a list of known RTP payload types. Note that, because of the useless functionality called "Dynamic RTP Payload", those values shouldn't be considered too much. The rtp_payload_type and codec association is in fact concorded through the Signaling messages (SIP, H.323, SCCP, ...), assigning new values also for those codecs already having a standard and predefined value
-h
Display a summary of the valid options and exit
```
The files in the output directory have the following naming scheme: The set of files with pattern rtp.x.* refer to the rtpbreak execution number x, the subset of files with pattern rtp.x.y.* refer to the RTP session number y (of the rtpbreak execution number x). At each execution and at each RTP session detection, x and y are respectively incremented. The set of output files of the rtpbreak execution number x is organized as follows:

```
rtp.x.txt
The rtpbreak execution log, always generated
rtp.x.noise.pcap
The noise packets, generated with option -n enabled
rtp.x.y.*
For each detected RTP stream y:
rtp.x.y.raw
The transported raw data of the RTP session y. Generated by default, can be disabled with option -w enabled
rtp.x.y.pcap
The reordered packets of the RTP session y. Generated by default, can be disabled with option -W enabled
rtp.x.y.txt
The y RTP session log, always generated
```

## Examples

In this section there are some commented examples.

### Record, mix and replay a VoIP call

**Scope**: We want to detect, reconstruct and decode a conversation between two VoIP Wireless phones, the final output should be a wav file. First of all, we sniff the packets with rtpbreak (fill gaps, sniff packets in promisc mode, gather packets from network interface wifi0, use './logz/' as output directory):
```

```
We've sent a SIGUSR2 signal to the rtpbreak process at call_length=1m2s, forcing a stats print. The final output directory content is the following:
```
xenion@gollum:~/dev/rtpbreak-1.3$ ls -1 logz

```
Those are the two RTP sessions logs:
```

Now, we've to decode, mix and replay this recorded call:
```

```
### Analyze an RTP session

**Scope**: We want to analyze a pcap file with some RTP streams, using the most aggressive configuration of the detection heuristics. First of all, we reconstruct the RTP streams with rtpbreak:
```

The set of files of the second rtpbreak execution have prefix rtp.1. Those are the three RTP sessions logs:
```

```
The wrong UDP checksum comes from the original network packet, rtpbreak only reorders the network packets of each RTP stream. As we did, rtpbreak can be used together with tshark/wireshark to handle complex needs.

## Particular scenarios

Scope: We want to (successfully) handle some particular scenarios. This is a list of problem description, (probable) cause and (hopefully) solution.

### Problem
An improbable high number of RTP sessions and noise packets is detected.
### Cause
There is some type of silence suppression.
### Solution
Dilate the timeouts:
```
rtpbreak -i eth0 -n -t100 -T100
```
### Problem
An expected RTP session is not recognized and some noise packets are detected.
### Cause
The conversation has been immediately terminated.
### Solution
Reduce the number of required packets for the multiple packets pattern:
```
rtpbreak -i eth0 -n -P2
```
### Problem
The expected RTP sessions are not recognized.
### Cause
The protocol is not RTP, the network interface is not in promisc mode, the conversation is very disturbed, the conversation was immediately terminated.
### Solution
Dilate the timeouts and reduce the number of required packets for the multiple packets pattern:
```
rtpbreak -i eth0 -m -n -P2 -t100 -T100
```
This is the most aggressive (and computationally expensive) configuration of the detection heuristics and will always detect any RTP session.

## How it works

The RTP sessions are composed by an ordered sequence of RTP packets. Those packets transport the Real Time data using the UDP transport protocol. The RTP packets must respect some well defined rules in order to be considered valid, this characteristic allows us to define a pattern on the single packet that is used to discriminate the captured network traffic from packets that can be RTP and those that securely are not. The fixed RTP header has this format:

 ```
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```
The following checks are performed (on each sniffed packet):

* *Destination UDP port*: The destination UDP port must be even, as specified in [rfc1889]. Beyond this, it must be greater than 1024. This because in the UDP and TCP transport protocols the ports <= 1024 are considered privileged and they can't be used by user applications, like VoIP clients.
* *Minimal packet size*: The UDP payload size must be greater than 12 bytes, this is the size of the fixed header always present in any RTP packet.
* *RTP version*: The RTP protocol version always used is 2, so the value of the V field in the fixed RTP header must be equal to 2.
* *Padding bit*: RTP allows to append some bytes as packet trailer, that must be ignored. The number of those bytes is specified exactly in the last packet byte. The P field in the fixed RTP header indicates if this functionality is active. If active, the RTP payload size is adjusted, checking it to be greater than 0.
* *CSRC list*: RTP allows the RTP Mixer to insert a list of contributing sources. This list, if present, follows immediately the fixed RTP header and it's composed by addresses (of 32 bits), their number is indicated by the CC field in the fixed RTP header. If present, the RTP payload size is adjusted, checking it to be greater than 0.
* *Extension bit*: RTP allows to extend the fixed RTP header. If present, this extension follows the fixed RTP header and the optional CSRC list. His format follows:
```
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

The length field indicates the extension size, header of the extension excluded. His presence is indicated by the X field value. If active, the RTP payload size is adjusted, checking it to be greater than 0.

The UDP packets passing those checks are considered like "maybe RTP" packets. Note that the IP and UDP packet checksums aren't checked because quite often they're erroneously computed by VoIP clients. The UDP packets passing those checks are compared with the already detected RTP sessions (this is called pattern over multiple packets). The comparison is done considering the following informations:
* *SSRC*: The value of the SSRC field in the fixed RTP header indicates the unique identifier of the Sender of the session. His value is constant in all RTP packets of the same session.
* *IP addresses and UDP ports* : The IP addresses and the UDP ports of the Sender and Receiver are constant in all RTP packets of the same session.
* *Sequence number*: The seq field in the fixed RTP header indicates the packet sequence number, a value that isn't necessarily initialized to 1 but that it's strictly increasing in RTP packets of the same session. It's considered a window of acceptable values for each session, that changes dynamically. This allows to consider the eventuality that some RTP packets may have been lost.
* *Timestamp*: The ts field in the fixed RTP header indicates the sampling timestamp of the first byte of the RTP payload, a value strictly increasing in RTP packets of the same session. Also in this case it's considered a window of acceptable values for each session, that changes dynamically. This allows to consider the eventuality that some RTP packets may have been lost.
If it's identified a possible session, the UDP packet is inserted in his buffer. If this doesn't happen, a new one is created. When to a session are assigned a minimal set of UDP packets, it's considered valid and any UDP packet in his buffer is considered definitely RTP. This must happen before a timeout, after that the session is considered a false positive (noise packets) and destroyed.

## Dependencies and compilation

This is a Unix-oriented application written in C. The compilation requires a C compiler like gcc and the following libs: libpcap (≥0.7), libnet (≥1.1). In debian, you need the following packages (or higher versions):
* libnet1
* libnet1-dev
* libpcap0.7
* libpcap0.7-dev

To compile, type "make" in the top directory.

In order to decode the RTP streams with sox, you need sox with the support for the required formats. In debian, you need the following packages:
* sox
* libsox-fmt-all
